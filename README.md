# Full-text search in Node JS

If you are building a website, e-commerce, a blog, etc., you will need a full-text search to find related content like Google does for every web page. This is an already known problem so probably you don't want to implement your own solution.

This project is a _Proof of Concept_ that uses the module [flexsearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flexsearch)

It exposes a web service using Express that allows request like this:

[http://localhost:3000/search?phrase=Cloud](http://localhost:3000/search?phrase=Cloud)
